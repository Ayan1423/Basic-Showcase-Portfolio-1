# Basic Showcase Portfolio 1 Repository
Welcome to the Basic Showcase Portfolio 1 repository! This project represents a simple webpage I created to practice frontend development skills. It includes basic HTML and CSS aimed at reinforcing my 
understanding of web design principles.

# Features
Clean, straightforward layout

Basic navigation elements

# Goal
The primary objective of this project is to refine my skills in building functional webpages and to experiment with layout and design concepts.

Feel free to fork this repository, modify the code, and make it your own!

Happy Coding!
